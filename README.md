# A-variation-of-N-Queens
This repository contains three different searches to solve the N-Queens puzzle

#Problem Statement
The problem statement is quite similar to the famous N-Queens puzzle.
In the N-Queens puzzle, you should place N Queens on a board so that there are no conflicts.
In this puzzle, the board can contain 'Trees' that can block a queen from another queen.
For Ex:
        Q      Tree  Q
        Tree   Tree  Tree
        Q      Tree  Q
This is a stable configuration because the trees block all the queens from each other.

Hence, given an NxN board and the arrangement of trees on the board, place M lizards on the board if possible.
If yes, return the configuration.
If not, return FAIL.
